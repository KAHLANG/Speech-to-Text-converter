Think of this project as the digital notepad — except, instead of typing, you speak. Built on the spine of ReactJS and fueled by the browser’s own Web Speech API, this app listens to your voice and turns it into structured, editable text in real time. Whether you're jotting ideas mid-walk or capturing thoughts faster than your hands can move, this tool is designed to keep pace with your mind. At its core, this isn’t just a speech recognizer. 
What It Offers:
Instant Speech Recognition- Speak and see your words materialize on-screen, thanks to the Web Speech API. No need for external libraries — your browser has this power built-in.

Effortless Saving- Capture voice notes and preserve them with a tap. The interface is built to honor your flow, not interrupt it.

Visually Thoughtful UI-Clean, component-based layout that adapts across devices, built entirely with Styled-Components for scoped and maintainable styling.

Zero Clutter, Maximum Focus-Every component — from pop-ups to cards — is designed to keep your focus on your thoughts, not the tool.

Here’s a snapshot of how the pieces fit together:

Everything here leans on clarity, modularity, and sustainability. No messy bundling. No overengineering. Just clean, functional code you can fork, extend, or maintain without dread.

Why It Matters:
Speech is one of the most natural human actions — more primal than writing or typing. But in digital workflows, we often ignore it. This app tries to bridge that gap without bloat or complexity. It's not trying to be Siri. It's just trying to listen well.
